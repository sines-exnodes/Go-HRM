# Organization Context

> **Org-wide context shared by every role** installed by `@ennamjsc/codex-scaffold`.
> Every role agent (dev, QA, BA, PM, tech-writer, data, HR, DevOps, …) reads this
> file at session start for company-level facts it must not re-ask or invent.
>
> **This file is yours.** The scaffold seeds it once and never overwrites it on
> re-run (`skip-if-exists`). Fill in the sections below and delete this note.
> Leave a field as `?` if unknown — agents must surface `?`, never guess (Rule 12/13).
